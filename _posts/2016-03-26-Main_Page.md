### This page will have the list of resources.

#### Check out these resources first to see if they have something for your target language.
* [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) - for basic ~ medium level learners  
* [Memrise](http://www.memrise.com/home/) - for vocabulary
* [Clozemaster](https://www.clozemaster.com/) - sentence completion. If you are a bit more advanced and want to challenge yourself
* [Readlang](http://readlang.com/) - make flashcards from any content on the web and learn them within context. Beta languages are really iffy / downright broken. If you are studying a language that is still in beta, use caution.
* Check if there are any national / public broadcasting organization that publishes content in your target language. They make frequent use of formal language and may have something interesting.
